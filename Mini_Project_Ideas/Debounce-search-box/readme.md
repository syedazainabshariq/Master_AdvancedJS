# Debounced Search Box 🔍

This is a simple project that demonstrates how to implement a **debounced search input** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

When the user types in the input box, the search is delayed by 500ms after the last keystroke. This is useful to avoid making too many API calls or unnecessary operations while the user is still typing.
