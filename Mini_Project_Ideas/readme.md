🧠 How It Works
When a user types in the input field and clicks Add Task, the task is added to a list and saved in localStorage.

Each task appears with a delete button (❌) to remove it instantly.

The filter input lets users type keywords and only shows matching tasks in real-time.

All interactions automatically sync with localStorage so that tasks remain after a page refresh.
